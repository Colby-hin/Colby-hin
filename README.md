# Hi, I'm Colby Hinchy 👋

IT professional looking forward to contributing to an organization’s success while continuing to expand my technical skill set throughout my career.
 
## Objective

Throughout my career so far I’ve been intrigued by the concept of understanding an enterprise’s infrastructure inside and out to pinpoint areas for improvement. I have experience troubleshooting network and technical issues, using tools like Jira, ServiceNow, MFA/SSO, and supporting identity and access management. My goal is to apply these skills while proactively contributing to an organization’s success, ensuring its infrastructure is resilient and secure.
